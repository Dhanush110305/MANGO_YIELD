# Mango Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting mango crop yield using machine learning techniques. By analyzing environmental and agricultural data, the model aims to provide accurate predictions to help farmers and stakeholders make better decisions regarding crop management and resource allocation.

## Overview

The mango yield prediction system leverages historical data such as weather conditions, soil quality, and farming practices to predict the expected yield. The project uses Python and machine learning libraries to preprocess the data, train a predictive model, and evaluate its performance. 

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature selection to improve model accuracy.
- Training a machine learning model to predict mango yield.
- Evaluation of the model's performance using standard metrics.
- Scalable for integration with larger agricultural datasets.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip install.
3. Replace the sample dataset with your mango farming data in CSV format.
4. Run the Python script to train the model and generate predictions.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Workflow

The workflow involves the following steps

1. Loading the dataset and performing data cleaning.
2. Preprocessing the data by normalizing and handling missing values.
3. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
4. Training the machine learning model on the training data.
5. Testing the model and analyzing its performance on the test data.

## Applications

- Forecasting mango crop yield based on environmental factors.
- Helping farmers optimize farming practices and improve productivity.
- Providing insights for policymakers and agricultural planners.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate additional features such as pest infestation data and irrigation patterns.
- Experiment with advanced machine learning models like neural networks.
- Deploy the model as a web or mobile application for real-time use.

## Conclusion

This project provides a foundation for using machine learning in agricultural yield prediction, demonstrating its potential to improve productivity and resource management. It can be further extended to other crops and farming regions for broader applications.
